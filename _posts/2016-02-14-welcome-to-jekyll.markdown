I guess that this is my new blog now. Super simple set-up using Jekyll/markdown/material theme. I'll be using this mostly for documenting/journaling as I go for the next few months but if someone else happens to be reading this then stick around I guess.

I'm working on a few things at the moment. All open source of course. üòÅ
A few chrome extensions, a couple of scripts, continuous updates to the look and feel and functionality of this blog, a few projects with my friend cruz.

My github link is at the bottom of this site, feel free to poke around and fork something, submit a pull request, whatever! Not much else for an introductory post I feel. Will be trying to post at least weekly but aiming for whenever i'm working on something to be sure to write about it.

See ya.
